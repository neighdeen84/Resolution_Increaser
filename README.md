# Resolution Increaser
### A resolution-increasing program.


## Project Description
This program takes input in the form of a house profile with a 15-minute sampling rate and converts it to 5 minutes. The output sampling rate doesn't necessarily have to be 5 minutes and can be varied, as long as it remains at a resolution that is higher than that of the input CSVs. The program also changes the year of the timestamp of the profile from 2013 to 2021.

## Requirements
```
pip install pandas numpy
```

### To get the code
```
git clone https://github.com/neighdeen84/Resolution_Increaser.git
```


## Usage
```
cd Resolution_Increaser
python main.py
```
